PROJECT - CAT DOG SVM CLASSIFICATION

AIM - The aim of this project is to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. This project will involve preprocessing the image data, training the SVM classifier, and evaluating its performance.

KEY FEATURES - 

Data Preprocessing:

Image Resizing: Resize all images to a uniform size to ensure consistency.

Normalization: Normalize pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 to aid the SVM in processing the data.

Feature Extraction: Use techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features to represent images in a format suitable for SVM.

SVM Classifier:

Kernel Selection: Choose an appropriate kernel (e.g., linear, RBF) based on the nature of the data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like Grid Search with Cross-Validation to find the optimal hyperparameters for the SVM.

Training: Train the SVM classifier on the preprocessed image data.


Evaluation:

Accuracy: Measure the accuracy of the classifier on a test dataset.

Confusion Matrix: Analyze the confusion matrix to understand the performance in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Calculate these metrics to gain more insights into the classifierâ€™s performance.

DATASET - 

The dataset used in this project is the popular Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset. This dataset contains:Training Set: 25,000 images of cats and dogs (12,500 images of each).

Testing Set: 12,500 images of cats and dogs.

CONCLUSION - 

Building a cat and dog classifier using SVM is an excellent project to understand the capabilities and limitations of SVMs in image classification tasks. Through this project, we demonstrated the entire pipeline from data preprocessing, feature extraction, training, and evaluating an SVM classifier. Despite being a relatively simple classifier, SVM can achieve high accuracy with appropriate preprocessing and feature extraction. However, for more complex image classification tasks, more advanced methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) may be more suitable.

Overall, this project provided valuable insights into machine learning techniques for image classification and highlighted the importance of proper data preprocessing and feature selection in building effective classifiers.
